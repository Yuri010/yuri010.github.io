# Coding-Snippets
Another pretty boring repo... I mean, they are just random snippets I use in my personal projects\
And as it has the WTFPL license, just do anything you want with it.

The "Critical Process" thingy can crash your PC if you don't use it correctly, explorerender can be pretty annoying, etc.\
Everything in there should be pretty harmless though.
