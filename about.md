# About Me
Well, where should I begin?

I'm Yuri[^1], I spend a lot of time just experimenting with for example virtualization[^2], servers, that kind of stuff (IT / ICT).\
I am also admin / half-owner of a [Dutch Tech and Hack server](https://disboard.org/server/723180597341847602), which is more for ethical hacking stuff (like Hack the Box, Try Hack Me, etc.) and just learning (about cybersecurity) but also programming.\
Furthermore, I also just play games :)

For what devices I use, you can look [here](https://yuri010.github.com/devices).

[^1]: not the anime / manga stuff, just look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury).
[^2]: Interested or do you need help? Maybe [this](https://disboard.org/server/770265840834314283) Discord is something for you!
