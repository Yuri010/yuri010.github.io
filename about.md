# About Me
Well, where should I begin?

I'm Yuri[^1], I spend a lot of time just experimenting with for example virtualization[^2], servers, that kind of stuff (IT / ICT).
I am also admin / half-owner of a [Dutch Tech and Hack server](https://disboard.org/server/723180597341847602), which is more for ethical hacking stuff (like Hack the Box, Try Hack Me, etc.) and just learning (about cybersecurity) but also programming.

Furthermore, I also just enjoy playing games, listening to music **but also making music :)**[^3]

For what devices I use, you can look [here](https://yuri010.github.com/devices).
