## Computers
Everything is interconnected using a TP-Link TL-SG1008 switch (8x 1Gbit full-duplex) for my little "local network".\
My old HP 6560b is the DHCP server for this network as the switch is unmanaged, and 3 computers trying to negotiate who is who is a no no

### Daily Driver (Laptop)
This is the laptop I usually use, it is a Lenovo Legion 5 (15ARH05),
I use this one for games and other stuff that doesn't really run on my other devices.

**Specs**:
 - AMD Ryzen 5 4600H (6c/12t) @ 4GHz
 - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti (Mobile)
 - Mixed DDR4-3200 (2x8GB) (1 DIMM Samsung and 1 DIMM Crucial)
 - SK_Hynix NVME M.2 (512GB)
 - Samsung 860 Evo SATA M.2 (In a caddy in the 2.5" bay) (250GB)
 - Windows 10 Home (Because- why Windows 11?)

### Old Daily Driver (Laptop)
This was my old daily driver, it is an HP ProBook 6560b (LE550AV).\
I use this one as a kind of gateway and Windows host. It runs stuff from Discord bots, to Minecraft servers to just a DHCP server for my local network.

**Specs**:
 - Intel Core i5-2520M (2c/4t) @ 3GHz
 - Intel HD Graphics 3000 (Mobile)
 - Mixed DDR3-1333 (2x4GB) (1 DIMM Elpida and 1 DIMM Hynix)
 - Kingston A400 SATA SSD (240GB)
 - Windows 10 Pro

### Old Old Daily Driver (Desktop)
This is a bit of a frankenstein. A friend of mine upgraded his PC and left me the hardware to screw around with.
The main use for it right now is as a virtualisation and file server.

**Specs**:
 - Intel Core i5-4590 (4c/4t) @ 3.7GHz
 - ASUS GeForce GT 730 (Passive (no fan lol), low-profile, 2GB VRAM videocard)
 - 14GB Mixed DDR3-1333
 - Hitachi Travelstar (250GB 2.5" Boot Drive)
 - ZFS RAID-0:
    - Hitachi Deskstar (250GB Hardware RAID 0 - Member 1)
    - Hitachi Deskstar (320GB Hardware RAID 0 - Member 2)
 - Seagate Baracuda (500GB Manual backup of the ZFS)
 - Proxmox VE 8

## Mobile Devices

### Daily Driver (Phone)
This has been my phone for the last couple of years, it is also my first ever smartphone lol.\
It is a Nokia 6.1 (2018, model TA-1043), it is an absolute brick and the stock software is generally *not too pleasant* (to keep things nice).

**OS**: It came with Android 8 stock, which got 2 major updates to Android 10 and then left support.\
After some hopping around between Lineage and some unofficial ROMs I found that [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-11-pl2-pixelexperience-aosp.4306647/) (albeit unofficial) Pixel Experience ROM works best. It's just overall stable, fluent and the battery life is better than stock, so thumbs up for that.
The only downsides about this is that it is still a custom ROM, so there is no support if it stops working all of a sudden, and NFC is broken, not that I can use Google Pay on an unlocked phone anyways :P

**Specs**:
 - Qualcomm Snapdragon 630
 - Qualcomm Adreno 508
 - 3GB RAM
 - 32GB Storage (eMMC 5.1)

### Backup (2nd Phone)
This is just an old phone a friend gave me. It is an old boi (2014) but it works fine tbh.
It is a Oneplus One, which is pretty lightweight, rather old but gold if you ask me.

**OS**: It came with Cyanogenmod 13 (Android 4) by default, but I upgraded it to the official LineageOS releases.
So now it is running LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11), and it runs like a dream.. It is great.

**Specs**:
 - Qualcomm Snapdragon 801
 - Qualcomm Adreno 330
 - 3GB RAM
 - 64GB Storage (eMMC 5.0)

### Tablet
This is my first mobile and Android device, like- ever.\
It is an Asus Zenpad S 8.0 (Z580CA / P01MA), it is an absolute beast in terms of multimedia (Display quality and audio), and can also run games pretty decent (Think of PUBG Mobile at 60fps locked on high settings).

**OS**: It came with Android 5 stock, which got 1 major update to Android 6.0.1 and then left support.\
I have unlocked and rooted this device using [this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/zenpad-s-root-achieved.3160422/page-66#post-75242374) XDA post, which took me a long while to find but was completely worth it :)\
(It is now running the stock Android 6.0.1 but it is rooted with Magisk 27)

**Specs**:
  - Intel Atomm Z3560
  - PowerVR G6430
  - 2GB RAM
  - 32GB Storage
