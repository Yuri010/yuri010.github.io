### Daily Driver (Laptop)
This is the laptop I usually use, it is a Lenovo Legion 5 (15ARH05),
I use this one for games and other stuff that doesn't really run on my other devices.

 - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti (Mobile)
 - Samsung DDR4-3200 (1x8GB)

### Old Daily Driver (Laptop)
This was my old daily driver, it is an HP ProBook 6560b (LE550AV),

### Old Old Daily Driver (Desktop)
This is the computer I've had before my old laptop. And what should I say...\
It has been used for gaming, storing games, just general stuff you do with a daily driver, it has served me well as a server combined with my old laptop, and now still does :D\
Just a good machine :)

**Specs**:
 - Intel Core 2 Duo E8500 (2c/2t) @ 3.16GHz

    - Hitachi Deskstar (250GB RAID 0 - Member 1)
    - Hitachi Deskstar (320GB RAID 0 - Member 2)

## Mobile Devices

### Daily Driver (Phone)
This has been my phone for the last couple of years, it is also my phone lol.\
It is a Nokia 6.1 (2018, codename PL2), it is an absolute brick and the software is generally *not too pleasant* (to keep things nice).

**OS**: It came with Android 8 stock, which got 2 major updates to Android 10 and then left support.\
I had an Unofficial Pixel Experience ROM on here until I bricked it using Magisk, after which I flashed stock again and decided to not do that dumb stuff on my main again.\
(It is now running the stock Android 10 again)

**Specs**:
 - Qualcomm Snapdragon 630
 - Qualcomm Adreno 508
 - 3GB RAM
 - 32GB Storage (eMMC 5.1)

### Tablet
This is my first mobile device and Android device, like- ever.\
It is an Asus Zenpad S 8.0 (Z580CA / P01MA), it is an absolute beast in terms of multimedia (Display quality and audio), and can also run games pretty decent (Think of PUBG Mobile at 60fps locked on high settings).

**OS**: It came with Android 5 stock, which got 1 major update to Android 6.0.1 and then left support.\
I have unlocked and rooted this device using [this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/zenpad-s-root-achieved.3160422/page-66#post-75242374) XDA post, which took me a long while to find but was completely worth it :)\
(It is now running the stock Android 6.0.1 but it is rooted with Magisk 25.1)

**Specs**:
  - Intel Atomm Z3560
  - PowerVR G6430
  - 2GB RAM
  - 32GB Storage
