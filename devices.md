## Computers
I recently decomissioned my entire overly elaborate "lab" setup that was basically just a PVE server as a giant external hard drive.
Since then the HP Probook, my desktop and my TP-Link switch are basically catching dust.

### Daily Driver (Laptop)
This is the laptop I usually use, it is a Lenovo Legion 5 (15ARH05),
I use this one for games and everything else basically.

**Specs**:
 - AMD Ryzen 5 4600H (6c/12t) @ 4GHz
 - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti (Mobile)
 - 16GB DDR4-3200 (2x8GB) (1 DIMM Samsung and 1 DIMM Crucial)
 - SK_Hynix NVME M.2 (512GB)
 - Samsung 860 Evo SATA M.2 (In a caddy in the 2.5" bay) (250GB)
 - Windows 10 Home (Because- why Windows 11?)

### (DECOMISSIONED) Old Daily Driver (Laptop)
This was my old daily driver, it is an HP ProBook 6560b (LE550AV).\

 - Kingston A400 SATA SSD (240GB)
 - Windows 10 Pro

### (DECOMISSIONED) Old Old Daily Driver (Desktop)
This is a bit of a frankenstein. A friend of mine upgraded his PC and left me the hardware to screw around with.

**Specs**:
 - Intel Core i5-4590 (4c/4t) @ 3.7GHz
 - ASUS GeForce GT 730 (Passive (no fan lol), low-profile, 2GB VRAM videocard)

## Mobile Devices

### Daily Driver (Phone)
This has got to be one of the best decisions I've made, but when I decided to finally pull the trigger and buy a new phone, I went big.\
It's a Google Pixel 8!! I have been absolutely loving it so far, it's just good at anything I throw at it and it has 7(!!!) years of support.

**OS**: Of course with that 7 years of support that also means Android updates, so this is running the stock Google firmware.\
At the time of writing this, that is Android 14 with of course the Pixel goodies Google gives you :P

**Specs**:
 - Google Tensor G3
 - Immortalis G715s MC10
 - 8GB RAM
 - 128GB Storage (UFS3.1)

### (DECOMISSIONED) Old Daily Driver (Phone)
This has been my phone for the last couple of years, it is also my first ever smartphone lol.\
It is a Nokia 6.1 (2018, model TA-1043), it is an absolute brick and the stock software is generally *not too pleasant* (to keep things nice).

**OS**: It came with Android 8 stock, which got 2 major updates to Android 10 and then left support.\
After some hopping around between Lineage and some unofficial ROMs I found that [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/closed-rom-unofficial-10-0-plate2-pixel-experience-2020-08-18.3994591/) (albeit unofficial) Pixel Experience ROM works best. It's just overall stable, fluent and the battery life is better than stock, so thumbs up for that.
The only downsides about this is that it is still a custom ROM, so there is no support if it stops working all of a sudden, and NFC is broken, not that I can use Google Pay on an unlocked phone anyways :P

**Specs**:
 - Qualcomm Snapdragon 630
 - Qualcomm Adreno 508
 - 3GB RAM
 - 32GB Storage (eMMC 5.1)

### Backup (Phone)
This is just an old phone a friend gave me. It is an old boi (2014) but it works fine tbh.
It is a Oneplus One, which is pretty lightweight, rather old but gold if you ask me.

**OS**: It came with Cyanogenmod 13 (Android 4) by default, but I upgraded it to the official LineageOS releases.
So now it is running LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11), and it runs like a dream.. It is great.

**Specs**:
 - Qualcomm Snapdragon 801
 - Qualcomm Adreno 330
 - 3GB RAM
 - 64GB Storage (eMMC 5.0)

### Tablet
This is my first mobile and Android device, like- ever.\
It is an Asus Zenpad S 8.0 (Z580CA / P01MA), it is an absolute beast in terms of multimedia (Display quality and audio), and was also able to run games pretty decently (e.g. PUBG Mobile at 60fps locked on high settings).

**OS**: It came with Android 5 stock, which got 1 major update to Android 6.0.1 and then left support.\
I have unlocked and rooted this device using [this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/zenpad-s-root-achieved.3160422/page-66#post-75242374) XDA post, which took me a long while to find but was completely worth it :)\
(It is now running the stock Android 6.0.1 but it is rooted with Magisk 27)

**Specs**:
  - Intel Atomm Z3560
  - PowerVR G6430
  - 2GB RAM
  - 32GB Storage
