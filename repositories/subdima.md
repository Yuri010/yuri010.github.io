# [SubDima](https://github.com/Yuri010/SubDima)
SubDima is a harmless(-ish) trojan I made.\
I sadly lost the source code of SubDima 1.0, so this is the 2.0 based around the same idea but even better :)

### How did it get its name?
Well, when I made it I was just thinking of random names. And as it doesn't distribute itself, I thought of "manual distribution".\
But that can't be a name for a piece of malware! So piece I made it into an anagram: "subdural intimation" and shortened that to "SubDima".\
Tada! You know have a trojan.

***even though its name is a shortened anagram of "manual distribution", DO NOT DO THIS PLEASE, I AM ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE IT DOES ([License](https://github.com/Yuri010/CIR-License/blob/main/License.md))***

### About the "trojan"
It copies itself to the temp folder of the user (%temp% or C:\Users\<user>\Appdata\Local\temp), then runs from there.\
To exit it, you need a 4 or 5 character key or smh, but when you try to close it once it makes it around 20 characters hehe.

It contains a bit of Visual Basic for the visual aspect of things, and to make it even more "scary" with key inputs you can't see.
