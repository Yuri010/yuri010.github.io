# [Youtube-DL Helper](https://github.com/Yuri010/Youtube-DL-Helper)
[Youtube-DL](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is a neat little program that can help you download content off of Youtube without having to go through sketchy websites with malicious popups and all that. But it is a CLI tool, meaning not many people will find it easy to use.

This simple script makes it easier to download both Audio and Video off of both Youtube and Soundcloud.

## Why?
Well... I basically explained that already :P\
This script just (partially) automates the process of downloading content using Youtube-DL and guides you through the parts you'll have to fill in yourself.

Like some of my other projects, this includes an updater script and a few checks to see if everything needed is there.\
So no worries! It will download everything it needs to work for you, saving you time and effort.
