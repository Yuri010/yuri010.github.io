Raed Tihs is a Discord bot that makes chatting a challenge.

Okay- but how? You see, the human brain doesn't really read words letter by letter. Instead, it relies on context and just for the letters to be there.\
This means that only the first and last letter have to be in place and the rest of the letters should be there, but not necessarily in order.

So what the bot does is scramble all the letters per word in a user message except the first and last ones, deletes the original message and sends the scrambled one as a webhook.\
That last bit allows the bot to look like the user by taking their profile picture and username for that part.

Essentially the bot only really required the right permission and a channel for it to live in which you can set up using ``%setchannel <channel>``
