# [WordWarden](https://github.com/Yuri010/WordWarden)
Wordwarden is a Discord bot that works as promised: It is the Warden of Words.\

Still confused? You give it a channel to rule, and anything you say first is yours! Anybody else trying to say that word? Oh no- you can't. You'll have to buy it, if the owner is generous enough to put it up for sale ðŸ˜ˆ

## Why?
Now, I have to admit: This was not my idea. I came across a bot that worked similarly in a random Discord server but they eventually removed it.\
As I couldn't remember the bot name or anything, I just took it as a challenge and decided to make my own!

## Alright, so what can it do?
Well- The basics involve just keeping track of everything being said in a specific channel and by who. If then someone else says something that is already claimed, it will display a temporary warning and delete the message breaking "the rules".
You can claim words by either just typing something first, or buying them from the marketplace.

Here are some of the commands summed up:
- ``&buy``: Purchase a word that is for sale
- ``&sell``: Sell a word you own
- ``&marketplace``: See words available for sale

You can check your balance with ``&balance`` and see which words you own using ``&inventory``.

## Demo!
