# (28/06/2022) First!!
Hello and welcome! This will be a place where I might (or maybe not, we'll see about that) be posting some guides, repository related things, and all that kinds of stuff.

This post will basically show how everything will look, though at the time of making this post, there isn't much here yet, but maybe that will change in the future.
For now you can look around [on the main page](https://yuri010.github.io) for what else there is to explore here :)
